## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (v14 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yaragehad/event-management-platform.git
cd event-management-platform
```

---

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend/` folder by copying `.env.example`:

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

Update `.env` values if needed:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/event_management_platform?schema=public"
PORT=3001
JWT_SECRET="change-me-in-dev"
```

Apply migrations and seed the database:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
node prisma/seed.js
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:3001`.

---

### 3. Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside the `frontend/` folder by copying `.env.example`:

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

Set API URL:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

Start the frontend:

```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

---

### 4. Database Setup & Dummy Data

1. Make sure PostgreSQL is running.
2. Create a database named `event_management_platform`.
3. Confirm `DATABASE_URL` in `backend/.env` points to this database.
4. Run migrations and seed data:

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
node prisma/seed.js
```

If seeding fails because data already exists, reset and reseed:

```bash
npx prisma migrate reset
```

This will recreate the schema and run seed again.

## Assumptions Made

During the implementation, the following assumptions were made to fill in gaps not explicitly defined in the User Journeys document:
- **Authentication & Roles:** It is assumed that users have single, strictly defined roles (Organizer, Venue Owner, Vendor, Staff, Guest) to simplify authorization logic.
- **Profile Fields:** Additional standard profile fields (e.g., age, phone number, bio) were added to the `User` model, assuming users need standard account management capabilities.
- **Layout Designer Coordinates:** Floor plan designs assume a relative coordinate system that scales automatically to PDF exports rather than strictly mapped physical dimensions (like square footage).
- **Messaging:** Messaging between users is assumed to be direct, plain text messaging without attachments for the initial scope.
- **Payments:** Any payment or invoicing flows are simulated visually and rely on status updates rather than integration with an actual payment gateway like Stripe.
